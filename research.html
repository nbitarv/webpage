                We introduce an algebraic structure which encodes a collection of countable graphs through a set of states, generators and relations. For these structures, which we call blueprints, we provide a general framework for symbolic dynamics under a partial monoid action, and for transferring invariants of their symbolic dynamics through quasi-isometries. In particular, we show that the undecidability of the domino problem, the existence of strongly aperiodic subshifts of finite type, and the existence of subshifts of finite type without computable points are all quasi-isometry invariants for finitely presented blueprints. As an application of this model, we show that a variant of the domino problem for geometric tilings of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is undecidable for \(d\geq 2\) on any underlying tiling space with finite local complexity.

                We study the computability of domino snake problems on finitely generated groups. We provide general properties of these problems and introduce new tools for their study. The first is the use of symbolic dynamics to understand the set of all possible snakes. Using this approach we solve many variations of the infinite snake problem including the geodesic snake problem. Next, we introduce a notion of embedding that allows us to reduce the decidability of snake problems between groups. This notion enables us to establish the undecidability of the infinite snake and ouroboros problems on nilpotent groups for any generating set, given that we add a well-chosen element. Finally, we make use of monadic second order logic to prove that domino snake problems are decidable on virtually free groups for all generating sets.

                We study the problem of realizing families of subgroups as the set of stabilizers of configurations from a subshift of finite type (SFT). This problem generalizes both the existence of strongly and weakly aperiodic SFTs. We show that a finitely generated normal subgroup is realizable if and only if the quotient by the subgroup admits a strongly aperiodic SFT. We also show that if a subgroup is realizable, its subgroup membership problem must be decidable. The article also contains the introduction of periodically rigid groups, which are groups for which every weakly aperiodic subshift of finite type is strongly aperiodic. We conjecture that the only finitely generated periodically rigid groups are virtually \(\mathbb{Z}\) groups and torsion-free virtually \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) groups. Finally, we show virtually nilpotent and polycyclic groups satisfy the conjecture.

                We study dynamical and computational properties of the set of bi-infinite self-avoiding walks on Cayley graphs, as well as ways to compute, approximate and bound their connective constant. To do this, we introduce the skeleton \(X_{G,S}\) of a finitely generated group \(G\) relative to a generating set \(S\), which is a one-dimensional subshift made of configurations on \(S\) that avoid all words that reduce to the identity. We provide a characterization of groups which have SFT skeletons and sofic skeletons: first, there exists a finite generating set \(S\) such that \(X_{G,S}\) is a subshift of finite type if and only if \(G\) is a plain group; second, there exists \(S\) such that \(X_{G,S}\) is sofic if and only if \(G\) is a plain group, \(\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) or \(\mathcal{D}_{\infty}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\). We also characterize finitely generated torsion groups as groups whose skeletons are aperiodic. 
                For connective constants, using graph height functions and bridges, we show that Cayley graphs
of finitely generated torsion groups do not admit graph height functions, and that for groups that
admit transitive graph height functions, the connective constant is equal to the growth rate of periodic
points of the skeleton. Finally, we take a brief look at the set of bi-infinite geodesics and introduce
an analog of the connective constant for the geodesic growth.

                We look at constructions of aperiodic SFTs on fundamental groups of graph of groups. In particular we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on \(\mathbb{F}_n\times\mathbb{Z}\) and \(BS(m,n)\) of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) inside an SFT on \(\mathbb{F}_n\times\mathbb{Z}\) or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on \(BS(m,n)\). In the case of \(\mathbb{F}_n\times\mathbb{Z}\) the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.

                Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) is a cluster-growth model that consists in a set of particles that are sequentially aggregated over a two-dimensional grid. In this paper, we introduce a biased version of the DLA model, in which particles are limited to move in a subset of  possible directions. We denote by \(k\)-DLA the model where the particles move only in \(k\) possible directions. We study the biased DLA model from the perspective of Computational Complexity, defining two decision problems The first problem is Prediction, whose input is a site of the grid \(c\) and a sequence \(S\) of walks, representing the trajectories of a set of particles. The question is whether a particle stops at site \(c\) when sequence \(S\) is realized. The second problem is Realization, where the input is a set of positions of the grid, \(P\). The question is whether there exists a sequence \(S\) that realizes \(P\), i.e. all particles of \(S\) exactly occupy the positions in \(P\). Our aim is to classify the Prediction and Realization problems for the different versions of DLA. We first show that Prediction is \(P\)-Complete for 2-DLA (thus for 3-DLA). Later, we show that Prediction can be solved much more efficiently for 1-DLA. In fact, we show that in that case the problem is \(NL\)-Complete. With respect to Realiaztion, we show that restricted to 2-DLA the problem is in \(P\), while in the 1-DLA case, the problem is in \(L\).

                We study the seeded domino problem, the recurring domino problem and the \(k\)-SAT problem on finitely generated groups. These problems are generalization of their original versions on \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) that were shown to be undecidable using the domino problem. We show that the seeded and recurring domino problems on a group are invariant under changes in the generating set, are many-one reduced from the respective problems on subgroups, and are positive equivalent to the problems on finite index subgroups. This leads to showing that the recurring domino problem is decidable for free groups. Coupled with the invariance properties, we conjecture that the only groups in which the seeded and recurring domino problems are decidable are virtually free groups. In the case of the \(k\)-SAT problem, we introduce a new generalization that is compatible with decision problems on finitely generated groups. We show that the subgroup membership problem many-one reduces to the \(2\)-SAT problem, that in certain cases the \(k\)-SAT problem many one reduces to the domino problem, and finally that the domino problem reduces to \(3\)-SAT for the class of scalable groups.

                In this work we study the role distortion plays on automorphisms groups of expansive dynamical systems. We begin by generalizing results from subshifts, linking distortion and non-expansivity, to arbitrary expansive systems, and explore the subset of symmetrically distorted automorphisms. Due to the generalization, we are able to determine that expansive automorphisms can never be distorted.
